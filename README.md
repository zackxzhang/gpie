# GPie
**G**aussian **P**rocess t**i**ny **e**xplorer

- **simple**: an intuitive syntax inspired by scikit-learn
- **minimal**: a compact core of expressive abstractions
- **extensible**: a modular design for effortless composition

Note that the project is still **under construction** - please expect sharp edges and occasional API adjustments.


### Features

- several "avant-garde" kernels such as spectral kernel and neural kernel allow for exploration of new ideas
- each kernel implements anisotropic variant besides isotropic one to support automatic relevance determination
- a full-fledged toolkit of kernel operators enables all sorts of "kernel engineering", for example handcrafting composite kernels based on expert knowledge or exploiting special sturcture of datasets
- core computations such as likelihood and analytical gradient are carefully formulated for speed and robustness
- Bayesian optimizer offers a powerful strategy in optimizing expensive-to-evaluate, black-box objectives

### Examples
Gaussian process regression on Mauna Loa CO<sub>2</sub>

In the plot, scattered dots represent historical observations, and shaded area shows the prediction interval made by a Gaussian process regressor trained on historical data.
