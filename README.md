# GPie
**G**aussian **P**rocess t**i**ny **e**xplorer

- **simple**: an intuitive syntax inspired by scikit-learn
- **minimal**: a compact core of expressive abstractions
- **extensible**: a modular design for effortless composition
- **lightweight**: as few dependencies as possible

This is a ongoing research project, and much of it is currently **under construction** - please expect bugs and sharp edges.


### Features

- several "avant-garde" kernels such as spectral kernel and neural kernel allow for exploration of new ideas
- each kernel implements anisotropic variant besides isotropic one to support automatic relevance determination
- a full-fledged toolkit of kernel operators enables all sorts of "kernel engineering", for example handcrafting composite kernels based on expert knowledge or exploiting special sturcture of datasets
- core computations such as likelihood and analytical gradient are carefully formulated for speed and robustness
- Bayesian optimizer offers a powerful strategy in optimizing expensive-to-evaluate, black-box objectives

### Examples

##### Gaussian process regression on Mauna Loa CO<sub>2</sub>
In this example, we use Gaussian process to model the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> at Mauna Loa as a function of time.

In the plot, scattered dots represent historical observations, and shaded area shows the prediction interval made by a Gaussian process regressor trained on historical data.


### Installation
```bash
pip install --upgrade gpie
```
coming soon on pip...

### Backend

- numpy: linear algebra, stochastic sampling
- scipy: optimization, stochastic sampling
